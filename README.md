# Text Based Dark Souls 3 Project
 This project is a reimagination of Dark Souls 3 as a choose your own adventure game. I chose to create this project as a massive fan of the series and programmer seeking practice. My hope is to provide fans of the series with a new way to experience one of their favorite titles, with a slight reimagination of the action combat elements players have come to know and love throughout the series. The game currently only allows players access up to the High Wall of Lothric, but has provided a framework for expansion throughout all zones. Combat options include: attack, heavy attack, roll, and estus flask. Boss behavior is designed to mimic the original, with multiple phases and increasingly varying attack patterns. 
 
Disclaimer: This project was a way for me to connect to a personal project and to learn. It is not meant to infringe on any of FromSoftware's intellectual properties, and if there are any concerns regarding this, I will happily remove the project.
